# Code Documentation
The client is written in Lua, and the code is broken down as follows:
- The randomizer client is loaded from the `reframework/autorun/randomizer.lua` file 
- Most of the client's functionality is loaded from the `reframework/autorun/randomizer/` folder.
- The AP client connection window is loaded from the `reframework/autorun/AP_REF/core.lua` file.

This documentation is a work in progress. All contributions are welcome.
